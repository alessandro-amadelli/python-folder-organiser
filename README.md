# FOLDER ORGANISER
## python-folder-organiser


## Instructions
1. Create a folder named 'Misc' in the same directory as the script (or just run the program the first time and the folder will be created for you)
2. Put all the files you want to organise inside the 'Misc' folder
3. Execute the script
4. Enjoy the tidy result


## Info
This program automatically sorts files depending on their extensions by creating dedicated folders and by moving each file in the right one.
Execution is pretty fast and it is not affected by the file size because the program does not copy and paste files but just renames them changing the path.
